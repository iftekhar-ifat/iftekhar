A comprehensive competitive programming platform that transformed how Leading University students practice algorithms and compete. Built with modern web technologies, it serves as the central hub for 500+ students to practice problems, track progress, and compete on a live leaderboard integrated with Codeforces.

## Key Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Engineered a three-tier permission system (Standard/Power/Admin) enabling safe community contributions while maintaining content quality
- **Codeforces Integration**: Automated problem status synchronization via Codeforces API, showing solved/unsolved problems in real-time
- **Multi-Modal Practice**: Three distinct practice modes—Topic-Wise problems, Codeforces Ladder, and Contest archives—catering to different learning styles
- **[Live Leaderboard](https://lu-cp-archive.vercel.app/dashboard/leaderboard)**: Ranks students by Codeforces performance with optional privacy controls, driving healthy competition
- **Progress Intelligence**: Visual tracking system with difficulty filtering and status management across all content types

## How It Works

1. **Onboard with GitHub**: One-click OAuth authentication via NextAuth.js
2. **Connect Your Profile**: Link your Codeforces handle to sync performance data
3. **Choose Your Path**: Practice by topic, climb the Codeforces difficulty ladder, or join contests
4. **Track & Compete**: Update problem status and climb the live leaderboard
5. **Contribute Back**: Power users review submissions; admins manage the entire ecosystem


### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Iftekhar-Ifat/lu-cp-archive.git
cd lu-cp-archive
npm install
# Configure .env.local with GitHub OAuth and PostgreSQL
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```
